## Overview
This challenge looks at using node to make an application that can generate a README file for the user. 
It works by receiving input from the user and then it compiles the input in the format that a README uses. This is helpful to users if they are in a rush and need it to be formatted. The application asks the user a series of questions and it receives the feedback from the user. This is stored in the array for later called data. It goes through the questions and then it asks which license the user would like. In the future I would like to add more types of licenses available since there are many. 
This application is helpful and would be highly useful outside of this class as well. If I am making a project or even a new programmer/coder, this application would be helpful because it would have all the details that a readme would need so that if I was confused or stuck on what a README needs to have, this application would walk me through it. 
## Successes and Challenges 
This challenge was a success since it functions properly. It asks the questions/asks the user to provide the necessary input and then it does export into the correct folder. 
I ran into a few confusing things while creating this application. I had to search up how use throw new error correctly and I had to change my fs.writeFile function a few times since I was confusing writeFile and writeToFile so I was getting errors since I was trying to import the data (input) into a file that did not exist. 
## Video description
In this video, I explain how this application works properly and go over my code. This is a demo.
